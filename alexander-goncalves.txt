    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
        A section is a concrete portion of your page, i.e. the intro or footer. A div is a generic, nonsemantic element used for grouping geographically related elements on the page.
    17. What is CSS used for? 
        Cascading Style Sheets are used to beautify the appearance of your html building blocks.
    18. How do we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page

        The difference is that ids are for unique elements, while class is for a group of related elements. You'd use id for a paragraph you want to have a distinguishing style, while you'd use class for all related paragraphs that you want to share a particular style.

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
        div.sidebar a {}

    35. How often should I commit to github?

        Step 4: In bash, navigate to the appropriate folder and Git init
        Step 5: git checkout -b 'branch-name' (to create a new branch)
        Step 6: Start making changes to the directory.
            *At regular intervals repeat steps 7-9*
        Step 7: git add . (to mount *all* your changes)
        Step 8: git commit -m "brief description of changes"
        Step 9: git push -u 'branch-name'
        
        Step 10: In github, go to your repository and make a pull request.
            10.a: Ensure you're comparing your branch, not the initial repository or master.
            10.b: add TL as reviewer
            10.c: Give thorough description of the changes made. 

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        An inline element stays on the same line as preceding elements, whereas block elements occupy their own line. e.g. <strong></strong> vs. <p></p>
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        Absolute positioning keeps an element stationed statically in the view, so moving around the page doesn't change it's position. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
         You can assign width with the width property. If you give the element max-height and max-width properties, it will never exceed those values. Flex boxes can assign proportional relationships.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block: div, section, and p
        inline: span and a
        inline-block: img
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
        The box model is the way html elements are displayed and can be manipulated by css. 
        The box is represented by content in the middle, the border which surrounds it, outer padding, and then a margin that extends the box.
        Here's what's wrong with it: the sizing of these components of the box model is counterintuitive. You will end up with elements overlapping each other and pushing each other around the page in ways that defy your design intention.
        Here's the fix: box-sizing: border-box. It takes padding and borders and incorporates them into your assigned width. Although Margins are outside the designated width, this will give you wiggle room to adjust the space between elements
